One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing . 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
The data contained in the tidy.txt file has been obtained by cleaning and organizing data downloaded via the following link
(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

Initial data(X_test,X_train) for test subjects and train subjects was available in different folders(test and train) 
with their subject and activity codes contained in seperate files(y_test,y_train,subject_test,subject_train).
These were merged using cbind and rbind functions to makes one dataset of all test and train subjects.
The columns with mean and standard deviation were extracted out.
The column names and activity labels were also added later to obtain our dataset.
The original column names were modified using gsub function to add more detail.

These were aggregated using aggregate function from base R and a datafram containing mean(mean of mean and mean of standard deviations) for each activity and subject 
was obtained.
There were 6 activities and 30 subjects, making it a total of 180 observations for 88 variables.
he features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAccelerometer-XYZ and timeGyroscope-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAccelerometer-XYZ and timeGravityAccelerometer-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroroscopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerometerMagnitude, timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude, tBodyAccJerkMag

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyAccelerometer-XYZ, frequencyBodyAcclerometerJerk-XYZ, frequencyBodyGyroscope-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude,
frequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.


The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
st Deviation(): Standard deviation
